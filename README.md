# Ace VR

3D printable STL files for the ACE VR handset. STLs are for personal use only and should not be sold.

Several different versions of the Rival S to choose from

- One piece handset without extended mag

- One piece handset with extended mag

- Three piece handset with removeable slide and magwell

The three piece handset prints much cleaner. The majority of the outside of the handset will be perfect and only require a little cleaning up around the trigger guard.

Removable slide version uses (3) M2x12 socket head screws.
(1) at the front under the barrel and (2) next to trigger guard.
Magwell has (1) M2x12 screw on front side and (1) M2x10 on backside.

Trigger and mag release are designed for this handset, but might work on other models by other creators. The mag release button uses (1) M3x6 button head screw

Trigger with support has extra support "wings" on it in case you have issues with bed ahesion and have trouble printing it. Just cut off the "wings" when completed and sand down the edges.
